# Machine Learning

This folder contains the various machine learning implementations used on the Mars Rover Dataset. The basic_model.py file contains a feed-forward neural network implementation that is used to classify which passes of data are "successful" or "unsuccessful". The adversarial_autoencoder.py file contains an implementation of an adversarial autoencoder to impose a Gaussian (or another) distribution on the latent space representation learned by the autoencoder framework. The models.py file contains the components of this network.
